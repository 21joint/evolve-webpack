Many years of nonstop writing, touring and musical experimentation with scores of previous, separate projects ultimately brought Mo, Allen, Matt and Grant together in the spring of 2017. RADDA RADDA. deliberately kept a low profile in the early days working rigorously writing, recording, and refining their sonic efforts into an Americana confessional of sports. Their music spans a bridge between heartbreak and "hell-why-not," built from howls at the moon, heartfelt lyrics and walls of dirty telecaster twang, all the while maintaining an unmistakable pop sensibility that succeeds in flighting shy of the predictable. Their debut album "life again" is now available!</p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </article>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <article class="bwdash-article">\n            <div class="container-fluid">\n              <div class="row">\n                <div class="col-12">\n                  <div class="bwdash-article--header">\n                    <div class="bwdash-talent--img"\n                         style="background-image: url(/src/assets/images/scibilia.jpg)"></div>\n                  </div>\n                  <div class="bwdash-article--body">\n                    <h6 class="text-blue mb-1 mt-3">Mark Scibilia</h6>\n                    <h6 class="mb-3">Opening for Maroon 5 on Saturday, August 4</h6>\n                    <p class="text-asphalt">Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, a city of perseverance and resilience, it\'s no surprice Marc Scibilia fiercely carves out his own path in the music world.
