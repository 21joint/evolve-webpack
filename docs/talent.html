                  RADDA RADDA is a Rock/Pop/Americana band from Mineapolis, MN, USA. Many years of nonstop writing, touring and musical experimentation with scores of previous, separate projects ultimately brought Mo, Allen, Matt and Grant together in the spring of 2017. RADDA RADDA. deliberately kept a low profile in the early days working rigorously writing, recording, and refining their sonic efforts into an Americana confessional of sports. Their music spans a bridge between heartbreak and "hell-why-not," built from howls at the moon, heartfelt lyrics and walls of dirty telecaster twang, all the while maintaining an unmistakable pop sensibility that succeeds in flighting shy of the predictable. Their debut album "life again" is now available!</p>

                <p class="text-asphalt">Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, a city of perseverance and resilience, it's no surprice Marc Scibilia fiercely carves out his own path in the music world. Encouraged by his musical family, Scibilia discovered his passion for songwriting at an early age. "I was convinced by the time I was 10 years old that I wanted yo make music for the rest of my life" he recalls. One month after graduating high school, against well-intentioned advice, he left home, landed in East Nashville and hasn't looked back. </p>
                <p class="text-asphalt mb-0">After tens of millions of streams on Spotify, national headlining tours, opening spots with Zac Brown Band, James Bay and Gavin DeGraw to name a few, collaborations with international powerhouse DJ and producer Robin Schulz, appearances on the Today Show, MTV EMAs, and songs in national ads and Super Bowl commercials, 2018 finds Marc Scibilia re-exploring his Buffalo roots. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, he's writing a new soundtrack for the Northeast: unapologetically raw and with nothing to prove, think Springsteen singing over Coldplay's Rush of Blood to the Head.</p>
